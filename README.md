# Express.js with Mongoose Project

This project is a server-side web application built using Express.js and integrated with Mongoose for MongoDB database operations. This README provides instructions on setting up the project and getting started with development.

## Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version X.X.X or newer)
2. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
3. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (whichever you prefer for package management)

## Setting up the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone [repository-url]`
`cd [repository-name]`

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the root directory of the project and install the necessary dependencies:

`npm install`

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Update the values in the `.env` file with your database credentials and any other environment-specific configurations.

`cp .env.example .env`


### 4. Start the Server

Once everything is set up, you can start the server:

`npm start`

The server should now be running on the specified port (default is usually `3000` or `4000`).

## Development Tips

- Use `npm run dev` to start the server in development mode with hot-reloading enabled (assuming you have a tool like `nodemon` set up).

- Make sure MongoDB is running before starting the server. On many systems, this can be done with the `mongod` command.

- Regularly pull the latest changes from the repository and keep your local copy up-to-date.
